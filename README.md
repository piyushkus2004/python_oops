# OOPs in Python #

## 1.  **Class** 
 *  Class is like a Template of Objects 
## 2.  **Object** 
 *   Object is the output of the class
 *   For example

   
      student s = new student() ;
   - refrence = dynamic constructor()

     refrence = student s ,  dynamic = new , Constructor name is same always as class

## 3.  **Refrence** 
 *   Refrence helps in accessing the  variables and objects that are stored in memory     
## 4.  **Abstrraction** 
 *   Abstraction refers to hiding the difficulty or executing information it shows only main information
 *   
   for example - printing a program in python without knowing the process happening inside the computer
## 5.  **Polymorphism** 
*    Polymorphism simply means that having many forms
*    
*    
## 6.  **Encapsulation**
*    
## 7.  **Inheritance**
## 8.  **Data Abstraction**
